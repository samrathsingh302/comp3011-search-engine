# Design Decisions Log

A running log of design choices made during the build. Each entry captures the decision, the alternatives considered, and the rationale. Entries that involved an AI-suggested mistake are flagged with an **AI note** line so they can be quoted verbatim in `GENAI_EVALUATION.md`.

## 2026-05-18 — Storage format: JSON on disk

**Decision**: Persist the inverted index as a single JSON file at `data/index.json`.

**Alternatives considered**: `pickle` (faster to load, smaller on disk, but binary and version-fragile across Python releases); `sqlite3` (overkill for a single-file deliverable; introduces a schema-migration burden); a directory of per-term shards (premature optimisation at this corpus size).

**Rationale**: The coursework brief allows a single file. JSON is human-readable, which makes the file inspectable by the marker without running the project. The expected size is on the order of a few hundred kilobytes for around 100 pages — small enough that load time is irrelevant. The atomic-write step planned for `src/storage.py` will give the JSON file the same crash-safety that `pickle` would not have provided by default.

## 2026-05-18 — Smoke test in the initial scaffold

**Decision**: Include one trivial test in `tests/test_smoke.py` from the first commit, even though the plan suggested an empty test directory.

**Alternatives considered**: Run `pytest -q` with no tests at all.

**Rationale**: With no tests collected, `pytest` exits with status 5, which would trip the `commit_session.ps1` guard and block the first commit. A two-assertion smoke test (`1 + 1 == 2` plus `import src`) confirms both the test runner and the `src` package layout work, costs nothing, and lets the auto-commit helper succeed.

**AI note**: The original plan's instruction "Run `pytest -q` (it should pass trivially with no tests)" was based on an old assumption that pytest treats "no tests collected" as success. Modern pytest exits 5 in that case. Caught before running the helper for the first time; corrected by adding the smoke test.

## 2026-05-18 — CI: Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12 matrix on ubuntu-latest with an 85% coverage gate

**Decision**: GitHub Actions runs the suite on three Python minor versions (3.10, 3.11, 3.12) with `fail-fast: false`, on `ubuntu-latest`, gated by `--cov-fail-under=85`.

**Alternatives considered**: a single-version job on the latest Python only (simpler, hides forward-compat issues); a wider matrix that also includes Windows and macOS runners (slower, costs minutes, gives little signal because the code has no platform-specific paths); a stricter `--cov-fail-under=90` gate (we'll get there, but the gate should not break the build on commits that are intentionally light on tests, e.g. pure-docs sessions).

**Rationale**: The coursework is graded on a marker's machine whose Python version we don't control. A three-version matrix proves the code runs unchanged on the entire currently-supported CPython range (3.13 came out as the latest stable; 3.10 is the oldest minor still in security maintenance at time of writing). `fail-fast: false` means all three jobs report even if one fails, which is what we want when diagnosing version-specific issues. The 85% floor is a baseline the build must always clear; the project target is 90% or higher and is asserted by individual test sessions, not by CI. Pip caching keyed on both requirements files keeps CI runs under a minute once warm.

**AI note**: First-draft workflow had `fail-fast` left at its default of `true`. Switched it off because hiding two of three matrix jobs on a single failure removes most of the diagnostic value of a matrix in the first place.
